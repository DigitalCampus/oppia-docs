Data Collected and Usage
==========================

What data is collected?
--------------------------------

When you use the Oppia app the following data is collected:

* your registration information (for example email address, phone number) - the
  exact information will depend on the implementation
* which courses you have downloaded, when you access any course activity, how
  long you spend in each activity, including your quiz scores, feedback
  responses, and media watched
* your IP address is associated with each activity you take in the courses
* your network connectivity status

Additionally, if there is a problem with the Oppia app, we use an automated bug
reporting system, this will provide us with additional information:

* your network provider
* the version of Android you are using and the make/model of your device
* system memory capacity and usage
* debug output of the error


How is your data used?
-----------------------

The data above is collected to:

* Provide a personalised experience in the app, monitor what percentage of course
  activities you have completed and passed; in order to award points and badges
* Determine the countries users are accesing from (using the IP address)
* Implementing organisations will often use anonymised or summary data to help
  analyse, monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the training courses
  provided. In this instance exactly how your data is used will depend on the
  implementing organisation.
* Bug reporting data is used to help fix technical issues and bugs in the Oppia
  app.
