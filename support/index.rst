Support and Help
==================

The best place to get help and support is to post a message on the 
`OppiaMobile Community site <https://community.oppia-mobile.org/>`_ 

When posting a message about any difficulties you might be having, the more 
information you're able to give about the problem and how to recreate it, the 
quicker it will be for us to help resolve the issue.

As a guide, this is usually the basic information we would need, though it 
will depend on the specific problem/issue:

* Expected vs actual outcome
* Steps to reproduce
* Full text of any error messages shown
* Screenshots/images
* App or server version number you are using
* Links to Oppia server dashboard (especially for server issues)
* Links to Moodle (especially for content issues)
