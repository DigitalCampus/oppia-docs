Content Development 
======================

This is designed to train content developers in how to create courses for OppiaMobile.

The training is designed to be run remotely (via skype/teleconference) with a small group of participants (max 5). There 
should be a break of at least 2-3 days between each session, to allow participants time to complete the follow up 
activities, practice what has been learned so far and review any recommended documentation.

Participants will require a good internet connection during the actual sessions.
