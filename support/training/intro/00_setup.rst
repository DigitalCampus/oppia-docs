Workshop Preparation and Set-up
==================================
 
Documents to prepare and print out:

* Participant workshop attendance sheet 
* List of phones - to include IMEI no, serial no, phone no, Google account and Oppia account
* Smartphone and solar lamp/chargers user agreement and receipt forms (2 for each attendee - 1 for us and 1 for them to keep)
* Participant consent form (2 for each attendee - 1 for us and 1 for them to keep)
* Contact sheet of all project members (name, role, phone no, email, location) (1 for each attendee)
* Training evaluation form (1 for each attendee to complete). To contain basic feedback questions/comments about the training (what they liked, didn’t like, what they learnt, general feedback etc). 
* Participant Surveys (Mobile phone usage and PNC & ANC skills / attitudes)
* Competency checklists 

Many of these (those that don’t need signatures etc) can be completed in Excel - instead of printing out and completing (and then needing to write everything up after).

Resources
-----------

* Laptop & projector
* Flipchart paper
* Post it notes
* Pens and notebooks (for each attendee)
* Digital/phone camera
* Ideally a wifi connection (if not available then need to use data connection - if neither available then training can still proceed, but some activities may need to be rescheduled for another time)

Setting up the Smartphones
-----------------------------

Setting up the phones is likely to be time consuming (approx half hour per phone), so best to have this done as far in advance as possible - especially if there may be any issues (eg in connection to install apps etc).

* Create an OppiaMobile account for each user
* Charge up phone
* When starting phone either create an new Google account or use an existing one
* From Google Play install:
    * OppiaMobile - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.digitalcampus.mobile.learning
    * WhatsApp - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp 
    * ES file explorer - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop 
* Start Oppia, log in with the user account and download all the required courses (or copy as zip files)
* Copy any required video resources onto the phone SD card. 
* Record all the details of the user accounts used etc in the list of phones. Also mark inside the phone (using permanent marker or similar) a unique identifier for the phone.
