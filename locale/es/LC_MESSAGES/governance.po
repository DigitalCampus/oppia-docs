"The community functions best when it can reach broad consensus about a "

"there to be multiple good arguments, no clear consensus, and for open "
"questions to divide communities rather than enrich them. The debate "
"absorbs the energy that might otherwise have gone towards the creation of"
" a solution. In many cases, there is no one 'right' answer, and what is "
"needed is a decision more than a debate. The SABDFL acts to provide clear"
" leadership on difficult issues, and set the pace for the project."
