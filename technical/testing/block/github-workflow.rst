GitHub Workflow
==================

There is a GitHub workflow that automatically runs all the test currently present in the block in every Push or Pull Request
performed against the git repository.

You can find the latest workflow script `here <https://github.com/DigitalCampus/moodle-block_oppia_mobile_export/blob/master/.github/workflows/oppia_mobile_export_ci.yml>`_.
