Testing OppiaMobile
======================

OppiaMobile incorporates several types of tests to make the app and server 
stronger and make sure updated code does not break existing functionality.

The processes for running the existing tests, and also how to add new tests, is 
described below:


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   
   app/running-tests
   app/adding-tests
   server
   
   
If you have problems or failures when running or creating tests, then please 
contact us via the `OppiaMobile Community <https://community.oppia-mobile.org/>`_
