OppiaMobile Code Style, Quality & Analysis
===========================================


OppiaMobile Server
--------------------

Code style
~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the OppiaMobile server is written in Python, code style show follow the 
`PEP8 style guide <https://pep8.org/>`_.

.. note::
  Not all the code currently meets the PEP8 style, but we're working on it as
  parts of the code are updated, but any new code added should meet this style.
  
Code Quality & Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use `SonarQube <https://www.sonarqube.org/>`_ for performing regular code
quality and analysis checks.

You can view the current report for the latest release branch at:

To install and run the SonarQube analysis yourself (e.g. if you have made code
updates and before submitting a pull request), see :doc:`these instructions
