OppiaMobile Code Style, Quality & Analysis
===========================================


OppiaMobile Server
--------------------

Code style
~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the OppiaMobile server is written in Python, code style show follow the `PEP8 style guide <https://pep8.org/>`_.

.. note::
  Not all the code currently meets the PEP8 style, but we're working on it as parts of the code are updated, but any new
  code added should meet this style.
  
Code Quality & Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use `SonarCloud <https://www.sonarcloud.io/>`_ for performing regular code quality and analysis checks.

You can view the current report for the latest release branch at: https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=django_oppia

To install and run the SonarCloud analysis yourself (e.g. if you have made code updates and before submitting a pull
request), see :doc:`these instructions <sonarcloud>`
