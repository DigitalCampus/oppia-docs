Upgrading to OppiaMobile Server v0.14.1
=========================================

All commands to be run when the Python virtual environment is active. If you
are skipping a release when upgrading (eg jumping from 0.12.0 to 0.14.0), check
there are no additional upgrade steps needed in the releases you are skipping.

Update packages
----------------------------
#. Run: ``(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt``

Update database 
-----------------

#. Run: ``(env)$ python manage.py migrate``
   
Update static files
--------------------

#. Run: ``(env)$ python manage.py compilescss`` - don't worry about the 
   unclosed files warning messages
#. Run: ``(env)$ python manage.py collectstatic``

Run update_summaries --fromstart
---------------------------------

This isn't strictly necessary for this release, but since a couple of the summary tables have been removed, it's likely
to be useful to run this anyway. Running this is now much faster than in previous releases

#. Run the update summaries command from start: ``(env)$ python manage.py update_summaries --fromstart``
#. This might take a long time (hours) for large implementations, see :doc:`/technical/manage/update-summaries`
