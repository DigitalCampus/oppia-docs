Upgrading to OppiaMobile Server v0.12.22
=========================================

Update packages
----------------------------
#. Run: ``(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt``


Update database 
-----------------

#. Run: ``(env)$ python manage.py migrate``

Populates the course_version field in the tracker model
-------------------------------------------------------------

In this release, a field was added to record the `course_version` of the 
course in each tracker. The current saved trackers don't have that value
filled, but we can populate it based on the current course activities.

To do it, run the following command:
   ``(env)$ python manage.py populate_courseversion``

Configure automated error emails
----------------------------------

For receiving the automated error emails (#OPPIA-868), you'll need to ensure
that in your ``settings_secret.py``:

*  your site is in ``Debug = False`` mode (i.e. a production server) 
*  you have email sending configured (see: :ref:`manualinstall-email`)
*  a valid email address to send the error emails to, eg 
   ``ADMINS = [('admin name', 'admin@email.org')]``

Run update_summaries from start
---------------------------------

#. Run the update summaries command from start: 
   ``(env)$ python manage.py update_summaries --fromstart``
#. This might take a long time (hours) for large implementations, but is 
   required to make sure the data for the no media completed is stored correctly
   
Update static files
--------------------

#. Run: ``(env)$ python manage.py compilescss`` - don't worry about the 
   unclosed files warning messages
#. Run: ``(env)$ python manage.py collectstatic``
