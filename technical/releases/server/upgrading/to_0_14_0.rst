Check backup user permissions
-------------------------------

If you are using a specific MySQL user for regular database backups, you will need to ensure this backup user has the 
``SHOW VIEW`` permission, otherwise the backup could fail.

To add the permissions, log into the MySQL command line as root user and run the following (adjusting database and user
name as appropriate):

``grant SHOW VIEW on *.oppia to 'backup'@'localhost';``
