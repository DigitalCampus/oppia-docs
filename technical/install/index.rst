OppiaMobile Server Installation
=================================

The easiest way to get up and running with an OppiaMobile server instance is to follow the :doc:`aws` instructions, 
as this has all the server/database set up and configured.

If you need to install on you own server, or set up on your laptop/computer for testing, then follow the :doc:`server` 
instructions.
