Dashboard Guide
=======================

The OppiaMobile server web interface allows you to:

* monitor the activity and progress of your learners.
* manage users and permissions
* manage courses and cohorts

Any user with an OppiaMobile account can log into the dashboard, but what they are able 
to view will depend on their permissions (see :doc:`../permissions/server`).
