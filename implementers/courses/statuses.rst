Course Statuses
=================

Draft
---------

*Designed for testing a course before being made available to users.*

Only users with Admin/Staff permissions, or those specifically with course 
viewer permissions for the course will be able to download this course to the
app.


Live
---------

*Designed for releasing a course to all users.*

All users will be able to download this course in the app.


Archived
----------

*Designed for courses which are no longer in use.*

No users will be able to download this in the app (including Admin/staff users)

Deleted
---------

Not strictly a status, as this means that the course has been deleted from the
OppiaMobile server. Archiving a course is usually much more appropriate.

Changing a course status
---------------------------

If a course is status is changed, then this will affect who can access it in 
the app. 

If a course becomes newly available to a user (eg moving from draft to live),
they will get notified in the app that a new course is available for them to
download.
 
If a users has a course on their app and they no longer have access to this
course (due to change in status, eg live to archived), they will no longer be
able to access the course in the app, they will get a message that it should be
deleted from their app.
