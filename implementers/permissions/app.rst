OppiaMobile App Permissions
===========================


In the OppiaMobile client (phone) app generally all users have the same functionality and permissions.

Restricting app permissions
----------------------------

There may be some cases (for example when using shared devices), where you may want to prevent app users from installing 
or removing courses, or change the particular app settings. The app has the option to set an admin password, which will 
then restrict access to options such as installing/removing courses. To enable this, go to the settings in the app, 
check the box to "protect admin actions with password" and enter an admin password.
