xAPI Integration
==================

.. note:: 
	This development is a work in progress, so not everything may be completed
	and tested well. We'd welcome any feedback and suggestions on how we can 
	improve on what has already been done. 

xAPI (Experience API) is a learning technology standard to collect data about
users' interaction with learning content from a variety of sources (see:
https://xapi.com/)

Oppia has a very initial implementation for exporting data in xAPI format, but
there is more info in this document about the rationale and our future plans:
