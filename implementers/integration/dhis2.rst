DHIS2 Integration
=====================

.. note:: 
	This development is a work in progress, so not everything may be completed
	and tested well. We'd welcome any feedback and suggestions on how we can 
	improve on what has already been done.
	
This is a very initial version of an integration, at the moment the DHIS2
integration just allows Oppia admins to download a CSV file with a monthly
summary of the users who have used the Oppia app in that month, the number of
activities and quizzes they have completed and the number of points earned.
