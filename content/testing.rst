Testing your course on your mobile
==================================

If you would like to test out your course on your mobile but without publishing 
it and making it available for learners, you can directly install the course on 
your mobile. Once you have edited your course content, export and download the 
OppiaMobile package (from the Moodle block in your course). Then copy this zip 
file directly onto your phone SD card. Copy it into the:

``/sdcard/Android/data/data/org.digitalcampus.mobile.learning/files/download`` 
 
directory (there is no need to unzip the file) on your phone. When you start up 
the OppiaMobile app, it will automatically install the course for you to test 
how it looks and feels on a mobile device.
