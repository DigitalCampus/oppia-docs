Adding quizzes
===============

Add all your questions as standard Moodle quiz questions and they will be 
exported to run as quizzes on the mobile device. Note that only questions which 
can be marked automatically can be exported, so any essay questions will not be 
exported as these require manual marking. 

Essentially the question types supported are:

* any question supported by the `Moodle GIFT format <http://docs.moodle.org/28/en/GIFT_format>`_ (with the 
  exception of essay) can be exported to OppiaMobile
* Drag and drop questions (new to core Moodle 3.1) are also supported
