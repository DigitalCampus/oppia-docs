Embedding Files in Page Activities
========================================

.. note::
    Embedding files in page activities is only supported for users with :ref:`app version 7.4.5<appv110>` or above. See
    additional info below for previous app versions.
    
In addition to adding file activities, you can also embed files (e.g. pdfs) directly in page activities.

How to embed a file
----------------------

XXXXXX (TO BE COMPLETED)

Recommendations
------------------

#. Not all file types can be opened in a default Android installation and require an additional app. E.g. a pdf file
   requires a pdf reader to be available on the device, and a PowerPoint will require an additional app for user to open
   on their devices. Before embedding files into pages, you should check that users will have the appropriate app to
   open the file.
#. Some document file types may be difficult to read on a small screen, involving horizontal and vertical scrolling. You
   should check how the files will display on your users devices, so they are easily usable.
#. If the embedded file is text heavy, it may be more appropriate to move this text to being directly in the page
   activity, rather than an external embedded file.
#. Embedded files will count towards the total file size of your course, so if you are including large files (or a lot
   of embedded files in a course), you may want to consider reviewing how usable this will be for your users. 




Activity completion
---------------------

By default, embedding a file in a page activity will then require the user to at least have opened the file for the page
activity to be considered as having been completed. You can change this default behaviour at app build level, by XXXXXX
(TO BE COMPLETED)

On unsupported app versions
-----------------------------

For users with :ref:`app version 7.4.4<appv109>` or below, if they try to open an embedded file they will get the
message XXXXXX (TO BE COMPLETED). Note that in the case where opening the file is required to completed the page
activity, users with unsupported app versions will be unable to complete the activity.
