Using images in your course
===========================

Adding course icon/image
-------------------------

Go to your course settings page in Moodle and upload an image into the course 
summary field – this image will then be used as your OppiaMobile module 
image/icon. If you upload more than one image into this field, then the first 
one will be used.

Embedded images
----------------

Any images you embed into Moodle page resources will also be exported. To ensure 
they will display well on the mobile device without horizontal scrolling, it is 
best to keep the maximum width of any uploaded images to be around 400px. This 
also assists in keeping the course module filesize down and makes it easier for 
users to download your course.

Adding activity icons/images
-----------------------------

You can add a custom image/icon for each activity. For page resources go to edit 
your page and upload your image/icon in the description field. For quiz 
activities, go to edit your quiz settings and upload you image/icon into the 
introduction field. 

On export you can specify the size and dimensions of these images for how they 
will appear in the app. The default is 135px wide x 90px height, but of course 
you can change to match the dimensions of your image (eg if you want to use 
square icons)

If you don’t specify a custom icon/image for your activity, but your activity 
includes an embedded image in the content, then this embedded image will be used
as the icon. If there are no embedded images and no custom icon, then a generic 
icon will appear for your activity.

Adding topic icons/images
-----------------------------

You can add a custom image/icon for each topic. To add a topic icon, edit the 
topic and upload the icon into the Summary field.

On export you can specify the size and dimensions of these images for how they 
will appear in the app. The default is 256px wide x 256px height, but of course 
you can change to match the dimensions of your image (eg if you want to use 
square icons)
