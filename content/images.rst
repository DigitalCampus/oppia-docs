Using images in your course
===========================

Adding course icon/image
-------------------------

Go to your course settings page in Moodle and upload an image into the course 
summary field – this image will then be used as your OppiaMobile module 
image/icon. If you upload more than one image into this field, then the first 
one will be used.

Embedded images
----------------

Any images you embed into Moodle page resources will also be exported. To ensure 
they will display well on the mobile device without horizontal scrolling, it is 
best to keep the maximum width of any uploaded images to be around 250px. This 
also assists in keeping the course module filesize down and makes it easier for 
users to download your course.

Adding activity icons/images
-----------------------------

You can add a custom image/icon for each activity. For page resources go to edit 
your page and upload your image/icon in the description field. For quiz 
activities, go to edit your quiz settings and upload you image/icon into the 
introduction field. All images will be automatically resized on export, so you 
don’t need to worry about figuring out the exact image dimensions/size. If you 
don’t specify a custom icon/image for your activity, but your activity includes 
an embedded image in the content, then this embedded image will be used as the 
icon. If there are no embedded images and no custom icon, then a generic icon 
will appear for your activity.
