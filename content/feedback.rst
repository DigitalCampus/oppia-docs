Adding feedback
=================

You can use the standard Moodle feedback activity to create feedback questions
in Oppia.

The feedback question types supported are:

* multichoice
* info
* label
* textarea 
* description
* multichoicerated
* numeric

In the Oppia app the feedback questions use the same question types and format
as the quiz content, except without the scoring and marking.
