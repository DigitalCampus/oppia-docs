Adding About/License information
==================================

If you have some general pages about your course you’d like to include, but you 
don’t want these to appear as course activities (such as about, 
acknowledgements, license information etc), then you can add these as page 
resources in the course summary/intro section of Moodle (‘topic 0′). Any pages 
added here will be included in the menu options in OppiaMobile when the user is 
viewing your course.
